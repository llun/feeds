The <a href=\"/blog/2020/12/2020-in-review\">first year</a> (2020) was cool as everyone starts to learn how to juggle things around. The <a href=\"/blog/2022/01/2021-in-review\">second year</a> became pretty distressing for me, especially when I got hospitalised (not due to that disease).</p><p>This year is supposedly better in many ways as it's almost \"post-pandemic\" with lesser restrictions, but the tiredness start to kick in for me. A lot of things happen, a lot of problems to be solved, a lot of uncertainties. Despite seeing other folks moving on with new plans ahead, I felt like I'm stuck. In this pandemic or post-pandemic sense, I feel like I'm still in 2020. In the career side of things, I feel like I've been stuck for more than 10 years.</p><p>On April, I <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cheeaun/status/1514565947884924937\">tweeted</a>:</p><blockquote>\n<p>Been working for 16 years (first web dev job, excluding my part-time freelance work while schooling) Seems like my career ladder has been flat for the past 10 years. Maybe my approach has been wrong all the while.</p>\n</blockquote><p>There's a few good replies, though sadly some were like \"me too\" answers 😢.</p><p>On July, I posted <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32008368\">this on Hacker News</a>, answering the question for \"<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32006252\">Ask HN: Where are all the senior front end engineers?</a>\":</p><blockquote>\n<p>I'm a senior FE engineer in Singapore, been doing FE since 2000, here's what I think:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Job descriptions and interviews now are skewed towards \"full-stack\" or backend. Most interviews are lacking or outdated due to the fast and volatile nature of FE.</li>\n<li>Literally no career progression if you're specialised in FE. Most BE or \"full-stack\" devs will be given a chance to become principal engineers, tech leads, engineering managers, CTOs, etc. I've seen folks with \"FE Team Lead\" titles but never goes beyond that.</li>\n<li>FE is a subconsciously looked-down field. Neither a designer nor an engineer. Product/design team won't involve you in meetings (but will treat you like a code monkey). BE/\"full-stack\"/API engineers will think your job is easy and keep throwing business logic stuff to FE.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote><p>This got <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6950717836327563264/\">reposted</a> on LinkedIn and gained quite a few reactions.</p><p>Overall, I'm not really looking for an answer. These are just rants. It may not apply to all other companies and of course, there are many other factors besides these areas. I can complain all day long but life goes on and I'll still need to do what I need to do. These feelings probably have escalated due to anxiety and recent incidents all over the world.</p><p>I needed a break.</p><p>So I quit my job and became unemployed since July. It took quite a long while for this feeling of unemployment to kick in, after all these years of working from home. When I have a job, I work from home. Now that I don't have a job, I'm still… at home 😂. I guess it became very obvious that my work and personal life are not properly separated.</p><p>I've talked with a few people and there are two kinds:</p><ol>\n<li>People who also felt like quitting and asking me how I manage to quit without any plans, regarding my career and my budget to sustain 😅.</li>\n<li>People who told me they've done it before, and it was liberating for them 😇.</li>\n</ol><p>This isn't the first time I have a career break. My first time was in <a href=\"/blog/2015/12/2015-in-review\">2015</a>. I personally describe it as \"school holidays for working adults\". At that time, I travelled to Tokyo and San Francisco. This time, I chose not to travel anywhere. I get asked why a lot of times and I mention that travelling is actually <em>more</em> tiring. I mean, it's tiring in a good and enjoyable way, but I don't need that now.</p><p>Being unemployed is a double-edge sword. It feels great not to think about work, but at the same time, it feels bad because <em>everything</em> needs money and it gets worse with the recent wake of mass <a href=\"https://layoffs.fyi/\">tech layoffs</a>. I personally know how this feels, not very affected by them, and have learned to prioritise my own mental health. I don't have the capacity to save others if I don't save myself first.</p><p>It's been 6 months of unemployment. I don't have plans yet but I'll just do what I can do.</p><h2>Projects</h2><p>This year started <strong>great</strong> for my side projects.</p><p>On January, <strong>Wordle</strong> became popular, so I <a href=\"/blog/2022/02/chengyu-wordle-is-not-a-love-story\">made my own variant of Wordle called <strong>Chengyu Wordle</strong></a> and it <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/leehsienloong/posts/484183366401131\">got mentioned by the Prime Minister</a> 😱!</p><figure><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/leehsienloong/posts/484183366401131\"><img src=\"/blog/images/screenshots/web/facebook-post-lee-hsien-loong-chengyu-wordle@2x.png\" alt=\"Facebook post by Lee Hsien Loong, with the content “Many Singaporeans have joined in the fun of playing Wordle - an online word puzzle game, where the goal is to guess a five-letter word within six tries.

I've been thinking about my whole career, my personal life, relationships, friendships and my passions.</p><p>I'll be hitting the big four-oh in 3 years (well, actually 2).</p><p>It feels kind of scary.</p><p>As others have moved on, getting promoted, trying out new roles, gained more responsibilities, moved out from their parents' house, got married, had kids, migrated to other countries, bought a new house, joined another company or found a new one, I feel… stuck.</p><p>It's hard to resist the urge to compare with other people's lives, even though I've always been doing things at my own pace.</p><p>It was quite timely when I saw this post on Hacker News: \"<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34052201\">Ask HN: Has anyone here turned around their life in their 40s?</a>\". Some responses mentioned that we're not alone as everyone else are also having same thoughts in varying difficult situations. Some people had worse, managed to turn things around and having a better life now in their 50s.</p><p>This career break is like pressing the pause button for me to think about what to do now and what I want to do in the future. Honestly speaking, <em>nothing</em> comes into mind, as I'm slowly re-adapting and maybe <em>undoing</em> all the things that has changed in my life thanks to the pandemic. They are not really big changes, but small ones add up.</p><p>I do know that no matter what happens, I need to do <em>something</em>. Nothing will change if I don't take any actions. In fact, things around me are constantly changing while I'm doing <em>nothing</em>, and these things will ultimately force or influence me to do <em>something</em>.</p><p>Oh well, looking forward to more uncertainties ahead.</p>","author":"Lim Chee Aun","siteTitle":"cheeaunblog","siteHash":"15c7c44e2960b5b47196ecb9d24e84a8cf386d0c7c30998ce31cc3eee11d971a","entryHash":"4adbb0acc004ba24cae62dd5407c6e2d9e955032252d6b95bf96a1e8cb835ab3","category":"Category2"}
