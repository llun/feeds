I took this route because from last week I have tried PCN on changi airport and it's really good. All path are in good condition and don't need to carry for crossing a road but PCN from Bishan to Circuit road is another story.</p><p>You can see my route here</p><figure></figure><p>I have to carry bike for crossing the pedrestrain bridge atleast 3 times and two with low ceiling under the road cause it very tired when arrived home.</p><p>I'm expected a lot better atleast don't need to carry a bike like this and have a traffic light for crossing the road.</p><p>So the best way for going to Bishan park I think is taking the MRT and go to the closest station (not sure is it AMK or Bishan) and bike from their. It will a lot easier than carry up and down.</p></div></div>","author":"","siteTitle":"@llun story","siteHash":"e492a4c5a091b6624e5872d8d003bc73eb1166cc8f88db58c44e1f8dfb9c7252","entryHash":"6a7d079c5baa10fa11db7cb0612c28020aacd856f80346329668d0502e7fecff","category":"Me"}
