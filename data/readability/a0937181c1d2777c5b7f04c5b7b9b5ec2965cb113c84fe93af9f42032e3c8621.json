Yes I can't cycle until this year and after learn it in April, I cycle to work almost everyday</li><li>Travel to far far away place. Paris, The first city outside south east asia which feel like Singapore at the time I went. It's super hot (40 degrees celcius! that's like living in Bangkok!), crowded with tourist, a lot of architecture and have a city bicycle all the place!</li><li>Watch football game in the stadium!</li><li>Attended 2 conferences! I thought it would not be tiring but it's super tired after the event everyday I joined.</li><li>Turn 30! and it's the first time that I don't have 3 years goal. Actually I don't even have a long term goal. Somehow it's suddenly floating away and don't have a clear image what I want to do. Is this because I'm getting old?</li></ul><p>So this is not a bad year, many things new. It just tiring for me. Next year I hope many things will slow down? but more important thing now maybe is finding a goal.</p></div></div>","author":"","siteTitle":"@llun story","siteHash":"e492a4c5a091b6624e5872d8d003bc73eb1166cc8f88db58c44e1f8dfb9c7252","entryHash":"a0937181c1d2777c5b7f04c5b7b9b5ec2965cb113c84fe93af9f42032e3c8621","category":"Me"}
